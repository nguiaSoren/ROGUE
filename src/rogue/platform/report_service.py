"""`ReportService` impl — render a persisted scan into customer artifacts (JSON / HTML / PDF).

The worker (`worker.py`) finalizes a scan by saving `ScanReport.to_dict()` under a fresh `report_id`
and stamping that id + the platform `score` onto the `ScanRecord`. This service is the read side: it
reconstructs a `rogue.report.ScanReport` from the persisted payload and re-renders it, layering in the
platform `score`/`risk_level` (which the bare SDK `ScanReport` doesn't carry). It owns no scan logic —
just persistence read + presentation.

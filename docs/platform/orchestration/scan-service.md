# ScanService — the single entry every surface calls

> Team B, Scan Orchestration. This doc specs `ScanService`, the one façade the SDK, the public API ([../api/scans-endpoints.md](../api/scans-endpoints.md)), MCP ([../integrations/mcp.md](../integrations/mcp.md)), and the dashboard all call to start, read, cancel, and list scans. It is the box labelled *Scan Orchestrator* in [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §2, sitting above `ScanEngine` and in front of the queue. It owns the `scan_runs` lifecycle and nothing below it. The contract here is the one frozen in [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §4 — this doc elaborates it, it does not redefine it.

Status: **BUILT (local).** Shipped as `DefaultScanService` in `src/rogue/platform/scan_service.py`, against the `ScanService` ABC in `src/rogue/platform/interfaces.py`. The queue ([./job-queue.md](./job-queue.md)), the worker ([./worker.md](./worker.md)), and the engine adapter ([./scan-engine-adapter.md](./scan-engine-adapter.md)) all shipped too. **One major deviation from this doc: there is no Redis.** Progress, cancellation, and idempotency are all carried by Postgres (the `ScanStore` rows + the queue's status column); the in-memory single-process mode uses a process-local dict. References to a "Redis overlay" / live-progress heartbeat below describe the *original design*, not the shipped system — the shipped worker writes progress straight into the `scan_runs` row on every callback (see [./worker.md](./worker.md)). Likewise the rich synchronous-validation table in §4 is aspirational: `DefaultScanService.create_scan` re-asserts only the endpoint-or-provider invariant and the idempotency check; pack/provider/budget validation happens upstream (Pydantic on `ScanSpec`/`TargetSpec`) or at engine run-time, not as a pre-enqueue gate in the service.

## 1. Responsibility — and the one rule

`ScanService` is the *control plane* for a scan: it validates a request, persists intent, enqueues work, and reads status back. It is emphatically **not** the *data plane* — it never fires an attack, never calls a customer model, never runs `ScanEngine.run`. That happens in [./worker.md](./worker.md), out of band.

The load-bearing rule, stated once in [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §4 and §7 and enforced here: **NEVER run a scan in the request thread.** `create_scan` does a row insert plus a queue push and returns — on the order of single-digit milliseconds — with a `ScanRecord` in `status=queued`. A full default-pack scan is dozens of customer-model round-trips plus judge calls (the `for prim in primitives` loop at `src/rogue/scan.py:57`); that work belongs to a worker process draining the queue, never to the HTTP handler that accepted `POST /v1/scans`. If `create_scan` ever blocks on `run_scan`, the architecture has failed exactly the way [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §2 warns against.

## 2. Where it lives

```
src/rogue/platform/
  interfaces.py        ← ScanStore / JobQueue / ScanEngine / ScanService / ReportService ABCs
  scan_service.py      ← DefaultScanService (this doc)
  engine.py            ← DefaultScanEngine wrapper            (./scan-engine-adapter.md)
  queue.py             ← JobQueue ABC + PostgresJobQueue impl  (./job-queue.md)
  worker.py            ← ScanWorker drain loop                 (./worker.md)
  store.py             ← ScanStore (in-memory + Postgres) — scan_runs/reports persistence
```

`src/rogue/platform/` is a new package — the platform layer above the existing engine. It depends *downward* on `rogue.scan`, `rogue.packs`, `rogue.schemas`, and `rogue.db.models`, and is depended on *upward* by `src/rogue/api/main.py` (Team A) and the SDK. Nothing in `src/rogue/scan.py` or `src/rogue/reproduce/` imports back up into `platform/`; the dependency arrow points one way, matching the §2 diagram.

## 3. The contract (verbatim from [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §4)

```python
class ScanService(abc.ABC):
    async def create_scan(self, spec: ScanSpec, *, org_id: str, project_id: str | None = None,
                          actor: str | None = None, idempotency_key: str | None = None) -> ScanRecord: ...
    async def get_scan(self, scan_id: str, *, org_id: str) -> ScanRecord | None: ...
    async def cancel_scan(self, scan_id: str, *, org_id: str) -> ScanRecord: ...
    async def list_scans(self, *, org_id: str, project_id: str | None = None, limit: int = 50) -> list[ScanRecord]: ...
```

Every method takes `org_id` and enforces it (§6). All four are `async` — they touch Postgres (`scan_runs` via the `ScanStore`, plus the `scan_jobs` queue) and the secrets layer, never CPU-bound work. `ScanSpec`, `TargetSpec`, `ScanRecord`, and the `ScanStatus` enum are the canonical types from [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5; this service constructs `ScanRecord`s and consumes `ScanSpec`s but defines none of them. `actor` (the API key id or user id that initiated the scan) is recorded for audit and is not part of the read shape.

## 4. `create_scan` — validate → persist → enqueue → return

The whole method is four steps, in order, and returns in milliseconds.

**Step 1 — validate the `ScanSpec` *before* anything is persisted or enqueued.** A bad `TargetSpec` must be rejected synchronously so the caller gets a `400`-class error, not a scan that fails in a worker minutes later. Reject before enqueue when: neither `target.endpoint` nor `target.provider` is set (the SDK's own constructor enforces exactly this at `src/rogue/client.py:79–80` — `"Client needs either endpoint=... or provider=..."` — and the service mirrors it); `provider` is set but unknown to `rogue.adapters.registry`; `pack` is not a known pack name (`load_pack` would `KeyError`); `attacks` names that filter to zero primitives; `max_tests`, `n_trials`, or `budget` out of range. `api_key_ref` is validated as a *handle* — that it resolves in the secrets layer (Team C, [../tenancy/secrets.md](../tenancy/secrets.md)) — never as a raw secret; per [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5 the raw key never reaches this service. Validation failures raise a typed error that Team A maps to the §5 error envelope (`{"error": {"code", "message", "details"}}`); they leave no `scan_runs` row behind.

**Step 2 — persist a `scan_runs` row in `status=queued`.** Mint `scan_id = "scan_" + ulid()` ([../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5 ID grammar), insert one row scoped to `org_id`/`project_id` with `actor`, `created_at`, the resolved spec, and `status=queued`, `progress=0`, all counters null. This row is the durable record of intent and the thing `get_scan`/`list_scans` read. Schema, columns, indexes, and the migration are owned by [../tenancy/data-model.md](../tenancy/data-model.md) (the `scan_runs`/`scan_jobs` tables shipped in migration `0022_platform_tables.py`). `ScanService` is the *only* writer that creates these rows and the *only* writer that sets `queued`.

**Step 3 — enqueue a job.** Push a job (`scan_id`, `org_id`, the resolved spec, `idempotency_key` if any) onto the queue via the `JobQueue` interface from [./job-queue.md](./job-queue.md). The insert (step 2) and the enqueue (step 3) must not drift: if the enqueue fails, the row is left `queued` and a reconciler/visibility-timeout re-enqueues it — the queue is the at-least-once delivery layer, so the worker tolerates a redelivered job (idempotent transition `queued→running`, §7). We never enqueue *before* the row exists, so a worker can never dequeue a `scan_id` it can't find.

**Step 4 — return the `ScanRecord`.** Build it from the row just written: `status=queued`, `progress=0`. The caller now has a `scan_id` to poll. No engine has run.

### Validation rules (step 1, in full)

These are the checks `create_scan` runs synchronously; each maps to a stable error `code` in the [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5 envelope so callers can branch on it.

| Condition | `error.code` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Neither `target.endpoint` nor `target.provider` set | `invalid_target` | Mirrors `src/rogue/client.py:79–80`. |
| `provider` set but not in `rogue.adapters.registry` | `unknown_provider` | `details.known` lists supported providers. |
| `pack` not a known pack name | `unknown_pack` | `load_pack(pack)` would `KeyError`; known packs are `default`/`aggressive`/`compliance` ([../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §3). |
| `attacks` filters to zero primitives | `empty_attack_set` | `filter_attacks(load_pack(pack), attacks)` (`src/rogue/client.py:161`) returns `[]`. |
| `max_tests` ≤ 0 or above the org's per-scan cap | `invalid_max_tests` | Cap is a tenant policy ([../tenancy/data-model.md](../tenancy/data-model.md)). |
| `n_trials` ≤ 0 or above cap | `invalid_n_trials` | More trials = more cost; capped. |
| `budget` ≤ 0 (when set) | `invalid_budget` | `budget` is the USD stop in `run_scan` (`src/rogue/scan.py:38`). |
| `api_key_ref` does not resolve in the secrets layer | `unresolvable_key_ref` | Handle is checked for existence, not dereferenced here. |

Validation is pure and side-effect-free: no DB row, no queue push, no secret dereference. The service never *holds* a raw target credential — it only confirms the `api_key_ref` handle resolves; the worker dereferences it at run time inside the engine adapter ([./scan-engine-adapter.md](./scan-engine-adapter.md)).

### Idempotency

`create_scan` accepts an `Idempotency-Key` (threaded from the `POST /v1/scans` header by Team A, see [../api/scans-endpoints.md](../api/scans-endpoints.md)). The key is stored on the `scan_runs` row under a unique constraint scoped to `(org_id, idempotency_key)`. On a replay with the same key, `create_scan` short-circuits *before* step 2 and returns the existing `ScanRecord` for the already-minted `scan_id` — same scan, no second row, no second enqueue. This makes client retries (network blip after the row was written but before the response landed) safe: one key maps to exactly one `scan_id` forever. Keys are scoped per org so two tenants' keys can never collide or cross-resolve.

## 5. `get_scan` — row + live progress

`get_scan` answers `GET /v1/scans/{id}` ([../api/scans-endpoints.md](../api/scans-endpoints.md)). It reads the `scan_runs` row scoped to `org_id` and returns it directly — there is no Redis overlay in the shipped system. Live progress is real because the **worker writes progress straight into the row** on every engine callback (`progress` 0–100, `n_completed`, `n_tests`, `top_attack`; see [./worker.md](./worker.md)), so a polling dashboard sees `progress` climb from successive `scan_runs` reads. (The original design below proposed a fast Redis heartbeat to avoid frequent Postgres writes; the shipped worker just writes the row per callback. If write volume ever matters, the heartbeat is the intended optimization — but it is not built.) The `ScanRecord` shape returned is exactly [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5: `score` and `report_id` are populated only once terminal (`report_id = "rep_" + ulid()`, set by the worker after [../reports/report-service.md](../reports/report-service.md) persists the report).

## 6. Tenant scoping — every method, no exceptions

Every method signature carries `org_id`, and every read/write is filtered by it. `get_scan(scan_id, *, org_id)` is `WHERE scan_id = :scan_id AND org_id = :org_id` — a `scan_id` belonging to another org returns *not found*, never the row (no existence oracle, no cross-tenant read). `list_scans` is `WHERE org_id = :org_id` with the optional `project_id` narrowing, `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT :limit`. `cancel_scan` checks `org_id` before transitioning. The service treats `org_id` as already-authenticated — Team A's key-auth middleware ([../api/auth-and-keys.md](../api/auth-and-keys.md)) resolves `rk_live_*`/`rk_test_*` to an `org_<ulid>` and passes it in; `ScanService` trusts that boundary and enforces the filter unconditionally. The hard-coded single-tenant `acme` of the current `src/rogue/api/main.py` is gone the moment this service is the entry point (kills the §7 Week-2 tech debt). RBAC (who within an org may scan/cancel) is layered above by [../tenancy/isolation-and-rbac.md](../tenancy/isolation-and-rbac.md); `ScanService` enforces the org *boundary*, not intra-org roles.

## 7. The `scan_runs` lifecycle this service owns

```
            create_scan                worker picks up            run_scan returns
   (none) ───────────────▶ queued ───────────────────▶ running ──────────────────▶ completed
                              │                            │                            
                              │ cancel_scan                │ run_scan raises            
                              │ (before pickup)            ▼                            
                              ▼                          failed                         
                           canceled ◀─── cancel_scan (cooperative, while running) ──────┘
```

`ScanStatus` is the single enum from [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5: `queued | running | completed | failed | canceled`. Who transitions each:

- **`→ queued`** — `ScanService.create_scan`, and only it (§4 step 2).
- **`queued → running`** — the worker on pickup ([./worker.md](./worker.md)); idempotent so a redelivered job (§4 step 3) is a no-op if already `running`.
- **`running → completed`** — the worker when `run_scan` returns a `ScanReport`; it writes `n_tests`, `n_breaches`, `cost_usd` from the report (`ScanReport`, `src/rogue/report.py:75`), the Team-F `score`, and `report_id`.
- **`running → failed`** — the worker when `run_scan` raises (adapter/auth/budget error); it writes the `error` string.
- **`→ canceled`** — `ScanService.cancel_scan` (§8), from either `queued` or `running`.

`ScanService` writes the `queued` and `canceled` transitions; the worker writes `running`/`completed`/`failed`. Terminal states (`completed`/`failed`/`canceled`) are absorbing — no transition leaves them.

### `ScanRecord` field population across the lifecycle

The §5 [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) `ScanRecord` shape is filled progressively; this table is the contract for what is set when, so the dashboard ([../dashboard/live-scan-ux.md](../dashboard/live-scan-ux.md)) and API ([../api/scans-endpoints.md](../api/scans-endpoints.md)) know which fields to expect null.

| Field | Set at `queued` | During `running` | At terminal |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scan_id`, `org_id`, `project_id` | yes (create) | — | — |
| `status` | `queued` | `running` | `completed`/`failed`/`canceled` |
| `progress` (0–100) | `0` | Redis overlay, climbing | `100` (completed) or last value |
| `n_tests` | resolved spec cap | — | final from `ScanReport.n_tests` |
| `n_completed` | `0` | Redis overlay | final count |
| `n_breaches` | null | running tally (advisory) | `ScanReport.n_breaches` |
| `top_attack` | null | best-so-far (advisory) | `ScanReport.top_attack` (`src/rogue/report.py:103`) |
| `score` (0–100) | null | null | Team F formula over findings |
| `cost_usd` | null | null | `ScanReport.cost_usd` (target-call cost; `src/rogue/scan.py:39`) |
| `report_id` | null | null | `rep_<ulid>` once report persisted |
| `error` | null | null | set only on `failed` |
| `created_at` | yes | — | — |
| `started_at` | null | set on `queued → running` | — |
| `completed_at` | null | null | set on terminal transition |

The `running`-column "advisory" values come from the Redis overlay (§5) and are absent in `list_scans` results (§8); the terminal column is the persisted source of truth.

## 8. `cancel_scan` and `list_scans`

**`cancel_scan(scan_id, *, org_id)`** — org-scoped lookup (a missing/cross-tenant id raises `KeyError`, which the API maps to `404`), then: if already terminal, it is a no-op returning the existing `ScanRecord` (idempotent). Otherwise it sets the row to `CANCELED` with `completed_at` and best-effort drops the queued job (`PostgresJobQueue` cancels via the job's status column; the in-memory queue exposes a synchronous `.cancel`). **Shipped caveat:** there is no mid-run cancel flag — the worker does *not* poll for cancellation between trials, and `ScanStore.update` is an unconditional `setattr` (no `WHERE status='running'` guard). So cancelling a job that has already been leased and is `running` marks the row `CANCELED`, but when the in-flight `engine.run` returns the worker's terminal write overwrites it back to `COMPLETED`. True cooperative mid-run cancellation (the conditional-write + cancel-flag design described below) is not built; effective cancellation is for still-`queued` jobs.

**`list_scans(*, org_id, project_id=None, limit=50)`** — the dashboard's and `GET /v1/scans`' backing query: org-scoped, optional project filter, newest first, capped at `limit`. Returns lightweight `ScanRecord`s straight from `scan_runs` (no Redis overlay — list views show last-persisted state, not live heartbeats; live progress is a per-scan concern handled by `get_scan`).

## 9. Refactoring the SDK `Client.scan` for hosted mode

Today `Client.scan` (`src/rogue/client.py:142`) runs the scan *in-process*: it `load_pack`s, `filter_attacks`, and `asyncio.run(run_scan(...))` synchronously (`src/rogue/client.py:158–172`), blocking until the `ScanReport` is built. That is the local/single-machine path and stays the default — it is the §2 promise that the same engine runs everywhere, just co-located.

Hosted mode adds an *optional* branch: a `Client` constructed against the ROGUE platform (e.g. `Client(hosted=True, api_key="rk_live_…")`, exact ctor signature owned by the SDK doc) routes `scan()` through `POST /v1/scans` instead of `run_scan`. In hosted mode `scan()` builds a `ScanSpec` from the same args it takes today (`attacks`, `max_tests`, `budget`, `pack`, `n_trials` → `ScanSpec`; the ctor's `endpoint`/`provider`/`model`/`system_prompt` → `TargetSpec`), calls the API, and either polls `GET /v1/scans/{id}` to completion (blocking façade, returns a `ScanReport` reconstructed from the persisted report — preserving today's return type) or returns the `ScanRecord` for async callers. The `api_key` becomes an `api_key_ref` handle on the way in: the SDK hands the target credential to the secrets layer, never inlines it into the `ScanSpec` ([../tenancy/secrets.md](../tenancy/secrets.md), [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §5). Crucially, hosted `scan()` does **not** import `rogue.scan` — it is a pure HTTP client of `ScanService` via Team A's API, so the same scan runs in the hosted worker, satisfying §2's "one engine" invariant. The local and hosted paths converge on identical engine behavior because both ultimately reach `run_scan`; only *where* it runs differs.

```

The customer never blocks on the engine: `create_scan` returns at the third row of the diagram; everything below it is the worker draining the queue out of band, exactly as [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §2 and §7 require.

## 11. Concurrency, races, and failure modes

The control plane is small but the seams between Postgres, Redis, and the queue have to be reasoned about explicitly, because the §1 rule means state lives in three places at once.

- **Row-then-enqueue ordering.** The row insert (§4 step 2) commits before the enqueue (§4 step 3). The window between them is the only place a `scan_runs` row can be `queued` with no live job; a reconciler (the worker's responsibility, [./worker.md](./worker.md)) re-enqueues any row stuck in `queued` past a grace period. The reverse window — a job for a non-existent row — is structurally impossible, which is why the order is fixed.
- **At-least-once delivery.** The queue is at-least-once, so the same `scan_id` can be delivered twice (e.g. worker crash after `running` before ack). The `queued → running` transition is a conditional update (`UPDATE … SET status='running' WHERE scan_id=:id AND status='queued'`) so the second delivery's update affects zero rows and the worker drops the duplicate. This is why §7 calls the pickup transition idempotent.
- **Cancel ↔ completion race.** `cancel_scan` on a `running` scan and the worker's `running → completed` write can race. The worker's terminal write is also conditional (`WHERE status='running'`); if `cancel_scan` already moved the row to `canceled`, the worker's `completed` write affects zero rows and the worker discards the report. Terminal states are absorbing (§7), so whichever conditional update lands first wins and the loser is a no-op — never a flip-flop.
- **Redis as advisory only.** Progress heartbeats and the cancel flag live in Redis, which can be lost (eviction, restart). Loss degrades gracefully: a missing progress key means `get_scan` falls back to the row (§5); a missing cancel flag means a cancel may not take effect until the worker re-reads the row's `canceled` status at the next trial boundary. Correctness lives in Postgres; Redis only makes the experience smoother.
- **Stuck `running` scans.** A worker that dies mid-scan leaves the row `running` with a stale Redis heartbeat (TTL'd) and an unacked queue job. The queue's visibility timeout redelivers the job; the conditional `queued → running` will *not* match (row is already `running`), so reconciliation here is by a watchdog that fails or re-queues rows whose heartbeat has gone silent past a threshold — owned by [./worker.md](./worker.md), surfaced to the customer as `failed` with an `error` of `worker_lost`.
